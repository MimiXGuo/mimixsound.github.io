        <p><a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">React Native</a> is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. 
            
            It has a large and active community, which means a lot of third-party libraries, resources, and support.
            React Native backed by Facebook and used in many of their products, which gives it stability and ongoing support.
        
        <br><br>
        React Native uses JavaScript that makes it accessible for many developers,and code reusability and hot reloading make it popular for rapid development.
        <br><br>

        However, It not fully "write once, run anywhere". Some platform-specific code is often required for complete cross-platform compatibility, and React Native can show less smooth performance compared to fully native or Flutter apps.
